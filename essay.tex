\section{Introduction}

In this paper, the author discusses an evaluation of two games "Erebus" and "Dreams".
The games are developed using unreal and are both VR games.
From my understanding, in both games you have a head mounted display on. However, one game uses an xbox controller whilst for the other
the particapants use a Hydra controller. 

A few things make me question the validity of the results of the usability test.
Firstly, the particapants of the test were all studying either a computing related course or a game development course. 
This means that all the particapants are likely to be around this kind of tech all the time. 
This, arguably may make it easier for them to understand the controls and how to play the games.
